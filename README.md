## About

bisant-geo is a Snakemake-powered pipeline that takes DCC files from a GeoMx experiment and performs quality control, normalization, basic unsupervised analysis, differential expression, and pathway analysis on your spatial transcriptomics data. 

## Usage
### Installing software requirements
To clone and run this pipeline, you'll need to have the following software installed on your machine:
1) [git](https://git-scm.com)
2) Some kind of conda package manager—e.g. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download), [miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install/), or [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html). I personally use mamba, for its speed.
3) Snakemake. Once you have your conda package manager set up, I (and the Snakemake people) recommend [using that to install Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html).

### Cloning the repository
A.k.a. downloading the pipeline to your machine. 
On the command line, navigate to the directory in which you want to download the pipeline, then use `git clone` to download it.
```bash
# Navigate to the directory where you want to save the pipeline.
cd path/to/directory/

# Clone the repository.
git clone https://github.com/alonzowolfram/bisant-geo
```
> **Note:**
> Replace `path/to/directory/` with the path to the target directory on your machine.

### Configuration
Now that you have the pipeline downloaded, you will need to configure the settings for your particular experiment. 

All the settings you will need to edit are stored in one convenient file, `config.yaml`, located in the `bisant-geo` folder you just downloaded. Open this file in your favorite text editor and edit the settings accordingly. See the comments above each setting for documentation. You can even store different configuration files in the `profiles` folder (or anywhere, really—it's just there for convenience) and call them with the `--configfiles` flag to the `snakemake` command when running the pipeline (see the section "Running the pipeline," below.)

### Setting up your conda environment
Using the `environment.yaml` file in the `bisant-geo/envs` folder, create a conda environment. See directions [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) on how to set up a conda environment from a YAML file. 

> **Note:**
> If you're on a Mac with an x86_64 ISA, you might have to prefix your conda environment creation command with `CONDA_SUBDIR=osx-64`. <br />
> For example, `CONDA_SUBDIR=osx-64 mamba env create -n geomx -f environment.yml`

### Running the pipeline
Now that you've set up your conda environment and the configuration file for your run, you can run the pipeline. To run bisant-geo, activate the conda environment you created above, then navigate into the `bisant-geo` folder. From there, running Snakemake is quite simple:

```bash
NCORES=3
snakemake --configfiles path/to/config.yaml --cores $NCORES
```

Replace `3` with the desired number of cores. If you're familiar with Snakemake, you can run individual modules as well, saving you time if you want to pick up from a previously completed run. For example:

```bash
snakemake --configfiles path/to/config.yaml --cores $NCORES -R --until unsupervised_analysis
```
will run the pipeline up to the "unsupervised_analysis" module.
<br />
<br />
A tutorial with more details is forthcoming. Sometime. Maybe. 
<br />
<br />
After the pipeline is finished running, the folder containing the output files will be available in the `out` directory. See the `README.md` file in the `out` directory for an explanation of the outputs. 

## Changelog
<b>2025/11/21</b> - v0.3.5-alpha:
* Pipeline now supports protein (NGS-based).
* Restructured `src` folder.
* Several bug fixes.
* Several new options in configuration file.
* New LMM method in differential immune-cell abundance that automatically calculates _p_-values.
* Updated plots in output HTML report.
* Added options for plot file type outputs.
* Script files no longer considered input in Snakefile.
* QC before differential expression to prevent linear algebra errors.

<b>2024/11/20</b> - v0.3.4-alpha:
* Added filter to differential expression analysis: mean value > 1. 
* Split expression into BIS and WTA.
* Added option to keep specified probes even if they don't meet probe QC cutoffs. 
* Removed marker identification from pipeline.
* Created a Shiny web app for probe QC.
* [In progress] Updated Snakefile so script files are no longer considered input. 
* Moved manual probe removal from probe QC module to after normalization.
* Output raw probe QC data: `NanoStringGeoMxSet_qc-probes-raw.rds`
* Bug fix: Immune deconvolution module calls the groups it splits the observations into `Group` when the `grouping_var` has > 50 unique values (levels). Changed this to `ChunkingGroup` so it won't interfere if the `grouping_var` is also named `Group` in the original metadata. 
* [In progress] Added QC before differential expression: filter out genes with mean expression < 1, so we don't get a linear algebra error. 
* [In progress] Fixed background subtraction + background normalization method. 

<b>2024/09/01</b> - v0.3.3-alpha:
* Bug fixes: error handling for various cases in 16S analysis, marker identification, and TCR analysis. 

<b>2024/08/01</b> - v0.3.2-alpha:
* Added data set filtering capabilities; can now filter GeoMx object based on annotation (pData) variables.
* Bug fixes: added grouping variable to graph title and file names for immune deconvolution; removed extra title slide from TCR section. 
* Added ability to choose whether to remove NAs from graphs in immune deconvolution.

<b>2024/07/25</b> - v0.3.1-alpha:
* Added ability to create neo-variables based on two or more existing variables.
* Added more functionality for grouping/subsetting data in downstream analysis modules (differential expression, marker identification, immune deconvolution).
* Bug fix: replace forward slashes (`/`) with underscores (`_`) in dynamically generated file names to prevent errors. 

<b>2024/05/17</b> - v0.3.0-alpha:
* Added several new normalization methods based on van Hijfte et al (<i>iScience</i>, 2023) and NanoString's GeoMx whitepaper.
* Corrected normalization method: previously, background subtraction and background normalization had been conflated; they have been given their separate normalization methods with the proper nomenclature.
* Added module for the detection of marker genes for a given group of data points and plot these markers as a heatmap. 
* Modules through the differential-expression module (i.e., unsupervised analysis, differential-expression analysis, and marker identification) now have the ability to be run on multiple normalization methods. 
* Improved automated dimension selection for graph export.

<b>2024/04/11</b> - v0.2.0-beta:
* Added differential-expression, pathway-analysis, and immune-deconvolution modules.
* Added ability to output PNG and EPS files.
* Plots added to PowerPoint now use PNG files rather than R ggplot objects.
 
<b>2024/03/22</b> - v0.2.0-alpha:
* Lots and lots of bug fixes.
* Added output: list of PKC modules.
* Added output: NTC summary.
* Changed default values of config.YAML to be more indicative of what should go there.
* Added ability to specify YAML config file via command line; added `profiles` folder for storage of YAML config files.
* Added Shiny app to see how different parameter changes affect number of viable segments.
* Cutoffs on segment QC graphs are now based on user-input values.
* Added functionality to correct names in annotation sheet to match functions' expected input.

* Added ability to start pipeline from a previous run. 
* Added ability for user to manually enter the PKC files to be used.

<b>2024/03/17</b> - v0.1.0-alpha released on GitHub.
