## About

bisantine-geo is a Snakemake-powered pipeline that takes DCC files from a GeoMx experiment and performs quality control, normalization, basic unsupervised analysis, differential expression, and pathway analysis on your spatial transcriptomics data. 

## Usage
### Installing software requirements
To clone and run this pipeline, you'll need to have the following software installed on your machine:
1) [git](https://git-scm.com)
2) Some kind of conda package manager—e.g. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download), [miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install/), or [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html). I personally use miniconda.
3) Snakemake. Once you have your conda package manager set up, I (and the Snakemake people) recommend [using that to install Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html).

### Cloning the repository
A.k.a. downloading the pipeline to your machine. 
On the command line, navigate to the directory in which you want to download the pipeline, then use `git clone` to download it.
```bash
# Navigate to the directory where you want to save the pipeline.
cd path/to/directory/

# Clone the repository.
git clone https://github.com/alonzowolfram/bisantine-geo
```
> **Note:**
> Replace `path/to/directory/` with the path to the target directory on your machine.

### Configuration
Now that we have the pipeline downloaded, we will need to configure the settings for your particular experiment. 

All the settings you will need to edit are stored in one convenient file, `config.yaml`, located in the `bisantine-geo` folder you just downloaded. Open this file in your favorite text editor and edit the settings accordingly. See the comments above each setting for documentation.

### Setting up your conda environment
Using the `environment.yaml` file in the `bisantine-geo/envs` folder, create a conda environment. See directions [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) on how to set up a conda environment from a YAML file. 

> **Note:**
> If you're on a Mac with an x86_64 ISA, you might have to prefix your conda environment creation command with `CONDA_SUBDIR=osx-64`. <br />
> For example, `CONDA_SUBDIR=osx-64 mamba env create -n geomx -f environment.yml`

### Running the pipeline
Now that you've set up your conda environment and the configuration file for your run, you can run the pipeline. To run bisantine-geo, activate the conda environment you created above, then navigate into the `bisantine-geo` folder. From there, running Snakemake is quite simple:

```bash
NCORES=3
snakemake --cores $NCORES
```

Replace `3` with the desired number of cores. If you're familiar with Snakemake, you can run individual modules as well, saving you time if you want to pick up from a previously completed run. A tutorial is forthcoming. Sometime. Maybe. 
<br />
<br />
After the pipeline is finished running, the folder containing the output files will be available in the `out` directory. See the `README.md` file in the `out` directory for an explanation of the outputs.
